# OpenAI Case Study

## Overview and Origin

**OpenAI** Was created and incorportated in 2015, and was founded by Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, Trevor Blackwell, Vicki Cheung, Andrej Karpathy, Durk Kingma, Jessica Livingston, John Schulman, Pamela Vagata, and Wojciech Zaremba, with Sam Altman and Elon Musk as co&ndash;chairs. The idea for this company originally came from Sam Altman, Elon Musk, Ilya Sutskever, and Greg Brockman with the stated goal to "advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole." [^fn1] OpenAI was initially a non&ndash;profit, invested in by Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Elon Musk, Reid Hoffman, Jessica Livingston, Peter Thiel, Amazon Web Services, Infosys, and YC Research. These investors have committed $1 billion to the company. [^fn2] In 2019 OpenAI moved to a *"capped"* for&ndash;profit format, with the profit being capped at 100 times the investment. The company also partnererd with Microsoft Corp. to build new Azure AI supercomputing technologies. [^fn3]

## Business Activities

>"Our goal is to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return. Since our research is free from financial obligations, we can better focus on a positive human impact. We believe AI should be an extension of individual human wills and, in the spirit of liberty, as broadly and evenly distributed as possible. The outcome of this venture is uncertain and the work is difficult, but we believe the goal and the structure are right. We hope this is what matters most to the best in the field." [^fn2]

Each of the Open AI many technologies have been marketed to a group that consists of almost all consumers with programs like Chat GPT, Dall&ndash;e, and Sora which allow for the user to create AI generated content that they themselves would be incapable of creating. With the switch to a *"capped"* profit business structure and with the exclusive partnership with Microsoft to create Azure OpenAI, OpenAI has shifted its targeted audience to "mid to large-sized businesses seeking to capitalize on cutting-edge AI capabilities." [^fn4]

>"Companies that use the power of OpenAI gain a competitive advantage by speeding up product development, enhancing customer experiences, and optimizing resource allocation. On the other hand, those that fall behind risk being left out in an increasingly AI-driven marketplace." [^fn5]

Due to OpenAI's standing as one of the top companies in their field, there is a lot that they can offer that other similar companies can not. Now, this isnt always the case due to OpenAI's practice of making most of their research and coding public for other companies to expand off of, however this does not impact OpenAI as much due to the gap in skill that OpenAI's developers have over their competition.

## Landscape

OpenAi is in the field of AI research and deployment. As an ever growing field, AI research and development has seen incredible growth in the previous 5&ndash;10 years, with a lot of that growth being attributed to OpenAI and their multiple generative AI programs such as, Chat GPT, Dall&ndash;e, and Sora. These programs have continued to push the boundaries of what a generetive AI can do especially with their most recent text&ndash;to&ndash;video AI, Sora.

A few of the many other major companies in this field would be Jasper, Bria, Sakana AI, and Anthropic. While these may be some of the top competitors in the field, Anthropic stands out due to its creation by siblings, Dario and Daniela Amodei, who were both executives at OpenAI until 2021 when they departed over ethical concerns with OpenAI having partnered with Microsoft to the investment of $1 billion.[^fn6]

## Results

The business impact of this company has so far led them from a non&ndash;profit to a *"capped"* for&ndash;profit due to wanting to expand to allow OpenAI to partner with Microsoft. It has also helped cause the incredible speed at which AI has become an everyday tool for companies to use. To measure the success and progress of companies like OpenAI is difficult since, as a research company they are free to set their own metrics. OpenAI has set their own metric for their success with 4 main metrics as outlined in their blog. These metrics include; Measuring progress through a variety of OpenAI GYM environments, Building a household robot, Building an agent with useful natural language understanding, and Solve a wide variety of games using a single agent. [^fn7] OpenAI has been doing well to progress through these metrics and an incredible pace over these last 5&ndash;10 years and is currently leading in the advancement of generative AI.

## Recommendations

If I were to recommend a product or service for OpenAI to offer, I would recommend as a next step to complete their generative AI collection, to create a text&ndash;to&ndash;music AI. I believe tbis would benefit the company by moving from an AI that can only generate visuals, to AI that can also generate audio as well. This advancement would be the seemingly next step after creating Sora, as a way to help companies market products and services to consumers. This technology could either be an entirely new project or simply an extension of Sora as it would most likely eventually need to be able to work together with a text&ndash;to&ndash;video AI to create proper marketing material and even possibly creative content that may not otherwise be possible.

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
>"Our goal is to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return. Since our research is free from financial obligations, we can better focus on a positive human impact.
We believe AI should be an extension of individual human wills and, in the spirit of liberty, as broadly and evenly distributed as possible. The outcome of this venture is uncertain and the work is difficult, but we believe the goal and the structure are right. We hope this is what matters most to the best in the field." [^fn2]


* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
Each of the Open AI many technologies have been marketed to a group that consists of almost all consumers with programs like Chat GPT, Dall&ndash;e, and Sora which allow for the user to create AI generated content that they themselves would be incapable of creating. With the switch to a "capped" profit business structure and with the exclusive partnership with Microsoft to create Azure OpenAI, OpenAI has shifted its targeted audience to "mid to large-sized businesses seeking to capitalize on cutting-edge AI capabilities."
